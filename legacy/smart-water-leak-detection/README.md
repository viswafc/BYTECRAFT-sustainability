# Smart Water Leak Detection & Monitoring Dashboard

## Overview

The **Smart Water Leak Detection System** leverages **Machine Learning** and **Interactive Dashboards** to detect and monitor water leakages in pipelines.
It uses IoT sensor data (pressure, flow rate, vibration, temperature, etc.) and provides **real-time leak detection, what-if analysis, batch predictions, and geo-visualization**.

This project consists of:

* **ML Models (Jupyter Notebook)**: Training and evaluation (`water_leak_detection.ipynb`).
* **Frontend Dashboard (Streamlit App)**: Interactive monitoring (`app.py`).

---

## Features

*  **Leak Prediction** – Detect leakage for individual pipeline inputs using trained ML models (Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, SVM).
*  **What-if Analysis** – Simulate different sensor values with sliders and instantly see prediction changes.
*  **Zone Map & Geo Analysis** – Interactive GIS map showing leak locations, active/dead pipes, and zone-wise analytics.
*  **Batch Prediction** – Upload a CSV dataset for bulk leak detection with downloadable results.
*  **Analytics & Insights** – Feature importance, model comparisons, and system insights.
*  **AI Assistant (Groq LLaMA Model)** – Ask AI for leak trends, maintenance insights, and generate plots dynamically.
*  **About Page** – Quick overview of the system.

##  Installation & Setup

###  Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Smart-Water-Leak-Detection.git
cd Smart-Water-Leak-Detection
```

###  Create Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate     # On Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate        # On Windows
```

###  Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

###  Run ML Notebook (Optional - Training Models)

Open `water_leak_detection.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab:

```bash
